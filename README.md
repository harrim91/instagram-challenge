#Instagram Challenge

Makers Academy Week 7 Weekend Challenge

Build an Instagram clone using Rails.

Users can create an account, sign in and log out (using Devise)
Users can perform CRUD actions on photos.
Photos are uploaded using paperclip and stored on AWS.

Views are written in haml and styled using Bootstrap.

The flash message styling stuff came from [potashin on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30884139/flash-message-does-not-have-bootstrap-classes)

Adding custom fields to devise users came from [a blog of the same title](http://jacopretorius.net/2014/03/adding-custom-fields-to-your-devise-user-model-in-rails-4.html) by Jaco Pretorius.
